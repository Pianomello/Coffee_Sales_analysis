## Overview

I have developed a dynamic and interactive Coffee Sales Dashboard in Microsoft Excel to analyze product performance, customer behavior, and sales trends. This project involved end-to-end data transformation, cleaning, and visualization by integrating multiple datasets (orders, customers, products). The final dashboard enables users to identify top-selling coffee types, key customers, and sales distribution by country and time.

## Key Features
  - Arabica emerged as the most sold coffee type across multiple months.
  - Certain countries and customers significantly contribute to total sales. Here, the United
States consumes more coffee than other countries. Similarly, Allis Wilmore buys coffee
more than any other customer.
  - The dashboard allows decision-makers to easily identify trends and high-performing
segments.



## Conclusion
This Coffee Sales Dashboard shows how Excel can be transformed into a full-featured data
analytics tool through its formulas, clean data organization, and thoughtful design.
