# Excel Dashboard for Coffee Sales Analysis


## Overview

I have developed a dynamic and interactive Coffee Sales Dashboard in Microsoft Excel to analyze product performance, customer behavior, and sales trends. This project involved end-to-end data transformation, cleaning, and visualization by integrating multiple datasets (orders, customers, products). The final dashboard enables users to identify top-selling coffee types, key customers, and sales distribution by country and time.

## Key Features


    - Arabica emerged as the most sold coffee type across multiple months.
    - Certain countries and customers significantly contribute to total sales. Here, the United States consumes more coffee than other countries. Similarly, Allis Wilmore buys coffee more than any other customer.
    - The dashboard allows decision-makers to easily identify trends and high-performing segments.
